### Task 1 design and comments
`Flask` is python micro webapplication that is light, fast and relatively simple to work with. It seems fit for this task.
Since there are no actual webpages served in this application, only a single python file is created, i.e., no template or static directories.

To run this app, the `requests` library will be imported as well.
